Fake News Detection

Author Vibhushit Bhatt 22BSA10132 Description

This repository contains a fake news detection project developed for the GEN AI course NLP assignment at VIT BHOPAL University. The project classifies news articles as fake or real using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. It uses Logistic Regression with the Kaggle Fake and Real News Dataset, achieving approximately 92% accuracy. The implementation is inspired by advanced workflows for clickbait and fake news article detection from a downloaded project, adapted for simplicity and accessibility. The repository includes: • my_fake_news_detection.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the implementation code. • confusion_matrix.png: Visualization of the model's performance. • explanation.md: Brief summary of the implementation (Phase 2 deliverable). • report.tex: Final report in LaTeX (Phase 3 deliverable).

Notes • This implementation is a simplified version tailored for accessibility, using Logistic Regression and the Kaggle dataset, distinct from the original project’s BERT and LSTM approaches. • Results were obtained by running the notebook on a standard laptop, ensuring practicality for the GEN AI course submission. Acknowledgments • Dataset sourced from Kaggle: Fake and Real News Dataset. • Inspired by a downloaded fake news detection project that used BERT and LSTM models, whose workflows (Figures 1 and 2) informed this simplified implementation.
